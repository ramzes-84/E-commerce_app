            The Ostara Glass Shop as a result of the development was made thanks to the numerous efforts of each team
            member. Upon completion of the project, we can confidently say that the team united and accurately completed
            all the assigned tasks. The development process was accompanied by mutual understanding and supporting to
            each other.
            <span className=" font-bold text-emerald-900 block">Technology stack:</span>
            <p>The application was built using modern web technologies such as Next.js, React, Typescript and Jest.</p>
            <span className=" font-bold text-emerald-900">Work coordination:</span>
            <p>
              To distribute tasks, set intermediate deadlines, ensure everyone understands the progress of development
              and avoid duplication we have used task tracking with Jira Kanban board. Communication in team took place
              in Telegram group chat. Skype meetings with mentor helped us in solving problems that have arisen in the
              development process.

            <span className=" font-bold text-emerald-900">Code quality control:</span>
            <p>
              For automatic code formatting and linting checks during the commit process we used Husky with ESlint and
              Prettier. Each PR should have gotten 2 approves before being merged in the sprint branch. In the
              repository we organized CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions for testing and Vercel Deployment for
              continuous application build and deploy.
